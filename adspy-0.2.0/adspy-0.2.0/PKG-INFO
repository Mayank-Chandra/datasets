Description: pyads is a simple way of interacting with a bibtex library built primarily from
        the ADS (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html). Your mileage may
        vary, but I've found it useful for quickly looking up cite info.  There are a 
        lot of improvements that could be made.
        
        Here's a short script to start showing the functionality.  I'll try to get get
        some more docs up here soon.
        
        lib = ADSLibrary('test')
        for t in ["2011ApJ...735...96S", "2008ApJ...689.1063S"]:
            lib.add_entry(t)
        lib.write_bib()
        lib.save()
        lib.find('Skillman')
        lib.find('Dinosaur')
        lib.find('2008ApJ...689.1063S')
        b = lib.find('Skillman2011')
        b.download() # Not fully tested
        b.open() # Also not fully tested.
        
        # You would import an exisiting bib library with:
        # lib.import_bib('library.bib')
        # lib.save()
